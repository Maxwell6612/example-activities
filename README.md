# Robocorp example activities

Each example activity directory contains a `README.md` that provides information regarding the activity.

These example activities are included with [Robocode Lab](https://cloud.robocorp.com/private/download-robocode), and can be opened from the Robocode Lab launch screen.

Another way to run these activities is to use [Robocode CLI](https://pypi.org/project/robocode/).

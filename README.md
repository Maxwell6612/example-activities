# Robocorp example robots

Each example robot directory contains a `README.md` that provides information regarding the robot.

These example robots are included with [Robocorp Lab](https://robocorp.com/download/), and can be opened from the Robocorp Lab launch screen.

Another way to run these robots is to use [Robocorp CLI](https://pypi.org/project/robocode/).

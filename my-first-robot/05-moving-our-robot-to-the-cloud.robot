# ## Part 5. Moving Our Robot to the Cloud
# 
# > Note: *Make sure you have first [linked your Robocorp Lab installation to Robocorp Cloud](https://robocorp.com/docs/product-manuals/robocorp-lab/linking-robocorp-lab-to-robocorp-cloud). If not, you can do so from the Robocorp Lab's Welcome screen and then reopen this tutorial.*
# 
# Before uploading our robot, we have to make sure everything is set-up in the Cloud for it to be welcomed into its new home. Robocorp has written its own robot to make this as easy as clicking a button, such is the power of software robots!
#
# Click the cell below, click `â–¸`, and then click the 'Visit Robocorp Cloud' button that appears below it.

*** Keyword ***
Visit Robocorp Cloud
    Open User Browser    https://cloud.robocorp.com

# All seems ready, let's publish our robot! Look to the top right of the Lab window, in the tool bar, and click the `Publish to Robocorp Cloud` button. Select the example workspace, the Google Image Search robot inside it and hit Publish! 
# 
# Now the robot from this file is available in the cloud! Please note that any changes that we make to our robot will have to be republished.
# 
# Now go back to the Robocorp Cloud in your web browser and try to run our robot from there.
#
# When you've done that, let's finish by looking at what we've learned and some ideas for further development.
